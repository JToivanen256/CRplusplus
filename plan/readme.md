The project plan should be added to this directory.

The first task of a group is to prepare a project plan. The plan can be a PDF document or it could be a markdown file in the plan directory that should describe at least the following aspects:

Scope of the work: what features and functionalities will be implemented, how is the program used, and how does it work

Our project is a Clash Royale-ish type of strategy game. The game loop will be the following:

You gain elixir just by waiting. With elixir you can "activate" cards that spawn entities on the battlefield. The entities will then march
toward the enemy encampent (towers, etc). If collidilng with the enemys sent enemies they will begin fighting. Every entity has their strengths and weakneses.

The high-level structure of the software: main modules, main classes (according to current understanding)

The planned use of external libraries

More detailed plans for the sprints: when do the sprints start and end, what high-level goals each sprint has, how the progress is followed during the sprint, e.g. when and how often will there be sprint meetings. It is recommended to agree already in the beginning a regular meeting time at least once a week. It is better to have short (e.g. 15 minutes) meetings frequently, than long meetings infrequently.
